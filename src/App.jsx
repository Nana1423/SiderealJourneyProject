            text="Not everyone on Earth sees an eclipse at a given time because eclipses occur in specific regions due to the alignment of the Sun, Earth, and Moon. Solar eclipses have a narrow path of totality, and lunar eclipses are visible from the nighttime side of the Earth where the Moon is above the horizon. The rest of the world may not see the eclipse because they are not in the right position to witness it."

            text="Eclipse seasons occur approximately every six months because of the alignment of the Moon's orbit with respect to Earth's orbit and the Sun. During these periods, solar and lunar eclipses are more likely to happen due to the Moon passing near its orbital nodes."
